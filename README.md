This repo contains Terraform code to create AKS and Specification file to deploy the TeachUA application AKS.

For local application testing using Docker Compose, you need to clone the backend and frontend repositories:
  1. Clone the backend repository:
     git clone https://github.com/DevOps-ProjectLevel/teachua-backend-NatVor.git
  2. Clone the frontend repository:
     git clone https://github.com/DevOps-ProjectLevel/teachua-frontend-NatVor.git
     Ensure you have Docker Compose installed locally to orchestrate the deployment of both components of the application.
